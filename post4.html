          <p>As a full-time student that works two jobs, it would be preaching to the choir if we debated about how stressful maintaining both responsibilites can be. I have many other friends who are also working during quarantine, and all for various reasons. Some are saving up, some are trying to help their families, and others simply just need something to do. After thinking about my own trials this semester, I decided to go out and see how others are fairing as well. </p>

          <p>On my personal social platforms, I decided to publish a poll directed to fellow college students on how their experience has been both working and going to school. Although the data collected was small, the statistics do shed light on a possible bigger trend. From the data, 100 students total responded and an overwhelming 75% of students answered that they feel overwhelmed with their workload, and 90% of the students felt like they could not talk to anyone about their stress. That dominating majority was shocking to me, but within the surprise I found it important to speak to the minority and provide information that can benefit all students.</p>

          <p>The 25% students that felt in control credited their mental state to daily habits that they practiced leading into the semester. They were aware that school would mainly be online, so they completely revamped their workflow to match. One interesting similarity between the group of students was that they placed a high importance on cleaning their rooms and keeping up with chores. The clean environment allowed them to feel clean as well, and allowed them to focus on their work alot more.</p>

          <p>Also, within the 10% of students who felt open, they also attributed that as a learned practice. Most said they would have answered otherwise if the same question was asked a year ago, but practicing self-compassion by being honest about struggles was high on their list of importance. Bit-by-bit, they made the effort to build their support system, and the availability to realease doubts has stress allowed some of these students to have the best semester they have ever had.</p>

          <p>This short survey helps illuminate the need for two things: the affect our habits have and the need to understand common humanity. We often overlook little things that can help us improve our daily lives. Little things like ironing all our clothes and fixing our beds can create the environment we need to be the best versions of ourselves. Also, it is important to remember that everyone faces challenges in life. When you feel defeated, if you take the time to expand your network, you can obtain resources that you might have overlooked and find new ways to challenge problems.</p>

          <p>The path to a stable life is not always crystal clear, sometimes adopting new ways of thinking and acting can make a big difference in the long haul!</p>
