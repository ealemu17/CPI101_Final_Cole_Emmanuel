          <p>The coronavirus, a pandemic that is sweeping across the nation. Around 200,000 lives have been killed and the number continues to increase. Which generates the question when vaccines are tested can mandatory vaccination be put in place to prevent further spread of the virus? I do not believe that should be done because the choice to vaccinate should reside with the U.S. citizen and not with CDC(Center for Disease Control) or WHO(World Health Organization).  </p>

          <p>I want all U.S. citizens to be educated within vaccine usage for the coronavirus. In doing so I want all U.S. Citizens to visit https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859. An informative site on the vaccination ingredient associated with vaccines as well as the research behind vaccines. I do not want individuals to intake vaccines because of the push of medical authorities, I want citizens to be educated in this pandemic.</p>

          <p>Why should all citizens be educated? I believe all citizens should be educated because the knowledge people possess determines the vision for the individual. Many people do not have an idea for what the vaccine can do to their body as well as the health risks associated. I believe vising this link will not only inform U.S. citizens but empower them through this pandemic. Health organizations may counter the use of optional vaccines because of the results vaccines can produce. </p>

          <p>However, that does not take away from the error margin that exists, being there is a risk factor. I am calling all U.S. citizens to not only visit the website provided but watch a video “WATCH: Canada's top doctor says education on vaccine important ahead of potential COVID-19 treatment”(Berthiaume). </p>

          <p>Now make an informative decision and decide to educate others on the effect of vaccines. By using social platforms to voice against the forceful use of vaccines medical alternatives must be accepted. The constitution was founded for the people meaning the force behind the government is the people. Therefore, the rights of the people should be at the forefront of all operations within the government. The people to decide what is injected into their bodies should be optional. Our system of government provides power to the American people. Now is the time more than ever to utilize all platforms and voice your opinion. Stop the potential mandatory vaccines and educate those who are unknowledgeable about vaccines in correlation to the coronavirus to take the same action. Vaccines do not guarantee the preservation of life and can be risk for long term-life expectancy.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Vaccine Obstacles</h2>

          <p>Ensuring vaccine safety. Several vaccines for SARS have been tested in animals. Most of the vaccines improved the animals' survival but didn't prevent infection. Some vaccines also caused complications, such as lung damage. A COVID-19 vaccine will need to be thoroughly tested to make sure it's safe for humans"(Mayo Clinic 1).</p>

          <p>"Protecting older people. People older than age 50 are at higher risk of severe COVID-19. But older people usually don't respond to vaccines as well as younger people. An ideal COVID-19 vaccine would work well for this age group"(Mayo Clinc 1).</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
