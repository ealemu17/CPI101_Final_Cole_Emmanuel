          <p>Depression and mental health, these topics get thrown around alot these days, but does anyone truly see the what is at stake here? Especially among college students during the pandemic, it is crucial that we are self aware and prepared for the continuting challenges ahead. Suicide ranks as the second leading cause of death amongst college students, and one in four people within the college demographic have reported genuinely contemplating suicide, according to data collected by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm?s_cid=mm6932a1_w" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC). These are very chilling statistics, especially when I read them (being a college student myself). Is there anything we can do to help prevent this statistic from exponentially increasing? Im here today to say we can!</p>

          <p>Different stressors in our lives make it very difficult to perform at the level we would like, and as a college student, all these various stressors are magnified. The burden of managing a school and personal life with the expectation of performing at a high level is unique to my demographic. After talking to some of my collegues as well, they were able to open up about how stressful things are, providing credibility to the CDC's statistics.</p>

          <p>It is important that we look out for eachother, pandemic or not. My friends have confessed that while some resources exist on campus for stress relief, some people feel like it is difficult to reach out to ASU for help because everything feels out of touch. Thats why student lead initiatives like this are important to re-establish the strength of the community.</p>

          <p>With that in mind. Here are my top 3 student tips on taking care of yourself!</p>

    

          <h2 class="section-heading">Self-Compassion Tips</h2>

          <p>1. Maintain A Healthy Diet: 
          I know it can be tempting, but that ramen noodle diet will not cut it! For proper productivity and health, your body needs its proper nutrients. Take the time to prepare yourself a balanced meal, or if your schedule does not allow try to be mindful of what goes in and out of your body. Overtime, you will see drastic improvements in your energy levels!</p>

          <p>2. Regulate Your Sleep Schedule: 
          This may seem like a boring answer, but as a college student, there is a strong habit amongst our group to limit our sleep. There is an odd belief that if we stay up over night and cram constantly that we will be at peak performance, but that simply is not the case. Your body needs the proper amount of sleep in order to work as needed. Even if you are worried about certain deadlines, you come first. That investment in your sleep schedule will give you more energy through the day, thus eliminating those cram session nights.</p>

      

          <p>3. Socialize:
           Although this step is definitely tricky to achieve during the pandemic, human interaction is crucial in staying alfoat in times like these. Staying crammed in your dorm or house for days on end WILL have an affect on you. As a student, one of the best methods to meet new people is to join a club! Even reaching out to people on social media is perfect, because the goal is to stay in touch with others.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">The best moments in life are the ones we share with others.</span>

          <p>Remember, the most important investment to make in your life will always be in yourself. Although things can get tough, everyone is in this together. By making gradual changes in your lifestyle, we will be able to drastically change the narrative of our generation and be the examples for those to come. Depend on your fellow classmates when you feel weak, because I can guarantee there is someone who understands.</p>
