          <p>Depression and mental health, these topics get thrown around alot these days, but does anyone truly see the what is at stake here? Especially among college students during the pandemic, it is crucial that we are self aware and prepared for the continuting challenges ahead. Suicide ranks as the second leading cause of death amongst college students, and one in four people within the college demographic have reported genuinely contemplating suicide, according to data collected by the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932a1.htm?s_cid=mm6932a1_w" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC). These are very chilling statistics, especially when I read them (being a college student myself). Is there anything we can do to help prevent this statistic from exponentially increasing? Im here today to say we can!</p>

          <p>Different stressors in our lives make it very difficult to perform at the level we would like, and as a college student, all these various stressors are magnified. The burden of managing a school and personal life with the expectation of performing at a high level is unique to my demographic. After talking to some of my collegues as well, they were able to open up about how stressful things are, providing credibility to the CDC's statistics.</p>

          <p>It is important that we look out for eachother, pandemic or not. My friends have confessed that while some resources exist on campus for stress relief, some people feel like it is difficult to reach out to ASU for help because everything feels out of touch. Thats why student lead initiatives like this are important to re-establish the strength of the community.</p>

          <p>With that in mind. Here are my student tips on taking care of yourself!</p>

    

          <h2 class="section-heading">Self-Compassion Steps</h2>

          <p>1.Maintain A Healthy Diet!
          I know it can be tempting, but that ramen noodle diet will not cut it! For proper productivity and health, your body needs its proper nutrients. Take the time to prepare yourself a balanced meal, or if your schedule does not allow try to be mindful of what goes in and out of your body. Overtime, you will see drastic improvements in your energy levels!</p>

          <p>2.Regulate Your Sleep Schedule
          This may seem like a boring answer, but as a college student, there is a strong habit amongst our group to limit our sleep. There is an odd belief</p>

          <blockquote class="blockquote">The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>

          <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

          <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
